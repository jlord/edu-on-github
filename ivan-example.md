1. Teaching tools ("educational playgrounds") - I created several teaching tools [1] [2] that students used in several courses  (1st, 2nd and 3rd year) to learn about concepts, practice, and work on lab assignments. I made webapp versions of such tools, open-sourced the apps on GitHub, and used GH pages for hosting the apps themselves. Not only did students love and use the apps, but several students reported bugs using GH issues (the majority used email for feedback), and two students contributed by developing some really cool features. I don't even have to say that they were thrilled to be able to work on the tools that they (and their colleagues!) were using on the courses they were taking. :) Other TAs also joined and contributed to the development of the tools, which was much easier using GitHub (we used branches, forks, issues...).

2. Workbooks - I created a workbook for one of our courses which contains problems from all previous exams, organised by topic (with pointers to material that explains how to solve each problem). The workbook [3] was written in LaTeX and both the tex and PDF versions were on GitHub. Again, students reported issues with the workbook (typos, questions that were not defined properly, etc) and appreciated that the source, not just the PDF, was available. 

3. Various other course-related material - We used the same tex+pdf approach for creating other material, including: lab assignments [4], basic information about a course [5] (schedule, teaching staff contacts, reading list), and handouts for classes [6]. All of these were hosted as separate repositories under an organisation for that course.

4. Projects for BS/MS theses - This is something I tried to do with some of the students I mentored. Basically, I'd get them to work on the software projects for their BS/MS theses on GitHub. For example, the MS thesis of one of my students was related to something I was doing research on. So we collaborated on the same project which was a GitHub repo [7], and I could track his progress and comment. The cool thing about this is that students were much happier when their software project was out there on the Web, visible to everyone, because they had a greater sense of contributing and accomplishment, and were motivated more (they knew they were also writing their resumes by doing this).

Overall, I think that students were happy with the fact that they had a place to report issues and fix stuff themselves if they wanted to. They appreciated the openness, and a lot of them learned about GitHub this way. Some students didn't care much for openness, but a lot of them did. And as I said - some students were thrilled, contributed in a true "open-source" way and improved the material that TAs created. That was for sure one of the more gratifying moments of my career in education. And all the material is now more maintainable, it's easier for TAs to improve them, collaborate and update. I also really like that the material was hosted on GitHub, which I knew was a stable location, rather stored as Word documents on various hard drives, email, or the university's CMS which changed every 2 years.  

I've also noticed researchers using GitHub for paper reviews: [8] [9].
