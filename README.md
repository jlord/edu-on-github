### Ways GitHub Could be Used

- Create a [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository) with images, .pdfs, .txt or [.md](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) files of lessons you've created.
 - Share the link with other educators.
 - Get their feedback and additions through pull requests.
 - Share the link with students!

- Create a [GitHub organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account--2) account for your school, add educators as members
 - Everyone is able to add materials, find materials, comment on materials, propose changes, track changes and share.

- Use [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) to create a website for a course.
